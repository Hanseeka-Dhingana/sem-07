### What is the Compiler  
   - Importance of Learning Compiler Design
   - Language Processing System
   - Compiler Structure/Architecture
       - Analysis and Synthesis Phase
   - Types of Compiler
       - Single Pass 
       - 2 pass compiler
       - Multi-pass Compiler
       - The Cross Compilers
       - Parallelizing Compiler
       - Hybrid Compiler
   - Cousins of Compiler
      - Assembler
      - Translator
      - Interpretor
      - Differences
   - Compiler VS Interpretor 
   - What is the Advantages of using compiler over interpretor and viceversa.
### Frontend And Backend in Compiler (also Difference)
