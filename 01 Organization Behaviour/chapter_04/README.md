# Emotions and Moods
Emotions are an unavoidable and powerful part of work life. Earlier, OB ignored them, assuming they harmed performance, but now thanks to the **"Affective Revolution"** emotions are recognized as crucial to understanding how people behave and perform in organizations.

## 💡 What Are Emotions and Moods?

To understand how people behave at work — especially in fast-paced, tech-driven environments — we must know the difference between **affect**, **emotions**, and **moods**.

---

###  **Affect (the umbrella term)**

**Affect** is a **general term** that includes **all kinds of feelings** — emotions and moods.
It’s the overall experience of feeling — whether positive or negative.

* Affect tells us **how we feel overall**, while emotions and moods describe the **type** and **intensity** of that feeling.

**example:**
When a software developer sees their code finally compile successfully after many errors, they experience **positive affect** — a general sense of happiness or satisfaction.

### **Emotions**

> Emotions are *intense, short-lived feelings* that are usually triggered by a **specific event or person**.

**Key traits of emotions:**

* **Intense** (high energy and noticeable)
* **Short-term** (fade quickly)
* **Caused by something specific** (a person, message, event, or situation)
* **Action-oriented** (they often make you *want to do something*)

 **example:**

* A UX designer feels **frustrated** when a bug in Figma keeps deleting their work.
* A project manager feels **excited** after a successful app launch.
* A customer support agent feels **angry** after being spoken to rudely by a client.

These are **emotions** — strong, short reactions caused by specific triggers.

### 3. **Moods**

> Moods are *less intense, longer-lasting feelings* that usually do **not have a clear cause**.

**Key traits of moods:**

* **Last longer** (hours or even days)
* **Less specific** (no single event triggers them)
* **Milder** in intensity
* **Affect how you see everything** (they influence emotions and decisions)

 **example:**

* A developer wakes up feeling **irritable** and low on energy, even though nothing bad happened — that’s a **bad mood**.
* A team lead feels **cheerful and optimistic** all day after a productive meeting, even during unrelated tasks — that’s a **good mood**.

So while **emotions** are like quick flashes ⚡, **moods** are like background weather ☁️ that influences your day.


### **How They’re Connected**

| Term         | Duration   | Intensity       | Cause          | Example                                  |
| ------------ | ---------- | --------------- | -------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| **Affect**   | General    | Varies          | Broad feeling  | Feeling positive after a productive week |
| **Emotions** | Short-term | High            | Specific event | Anger at a slow-loading app              |
| **Moods**    | Long-term  | Low to moderate | No clear event | Feeling down all day for no reason       |

## **Positive vs. Negative Affect**
As we learned earlier, affect means our overall emotional state — how we feel in general.
Now, to study affect more clearly, psychologists divide it into two main categories:

- Positive Affect (PA)
- Negative Affect (NA)
### 1. Positive Affect (PA)

Positive affect represents feelings of enthusiasm, excitement, energy, joy, and satisfaction.
People high in positive affect tend to be:
- Happy 
- Energetic 
- Optimistic 
- Enthusiastic about their work

### 2. Negative Affect (NA)
Negative affect represents feelings of nervousness, stress, guilt, anger, fear, or anxiety.
People high in negative affect tend to feel:
- Worried 
- Irritated 
- Anxious 
- Stressed

## People Differ in Affectivity   
| Type of Person                | Description                                       | Example                                                                           |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **High Affect Intensity**     | Feels emotions very strongly and frequently       | A team lead who gets *super excited* by success but *deeply frustrated* by errors |
| **Low Affect Intensity**      | Feels emotions mildly and rarely                  | A calm developer who stays steady no matter what happens                          |
| **PA-dominant / NA-dominant** | Naturally leans toward positive or negative moods | Some people are mostly cheerful; others often feel tense or worried               |

  
### 🧑‍💻 6. **Why It Matters in the Workplace**

* **Decision-making:**
  Emotions affect how employees think. A happy developer might take creative risks, while a stressed one might avoid new ideas.

* **Teamwork:**
  A team in a positive mood collaborates better. Negative moods spread quickly and reduce cooperation.

* **Customer Experience:**
  In customer service or tech support, the employee’s emotion (calm vs. irritated) directly shapes customer satisfaction.

* **Performance:**
  Positive emotions boost energy and innovation, while negative ones, if prolonged, cause burnout or turnover.

### 💬 7. **Real-Life Example (Amazon Case from Text)**

When **Amazon raised its minimum wage**, employees like *Fauston Martinez* felt **delighted** (emotion) because of a specific event.
That emotional uplift later turned into a **positive mood**, making him more satisfied and engaged at work over time.

### 💻 8. **Tech Workplace Scenario (Full Example)**

Imagine a **software startup**:

* Morning: A developer gets a Slack message — “Great job fixing that bug!” → feels **happy and proud** (emotion).
* Afternoon: That happiness lasts throughout the day, making them **more cooperative and motivated** (mood).
* Evening: The system crashes and the same person feels **angry** (emotion).
* Next day: They feel generally **tired and unmotivated**, even after the system is fine — a **bad mood**.





Would you like me to make a **diagram or visual table (like Exhibit 4-1)** to clearly show how affect, emotions, and moods relate to each other? It’ll look just like the one in your OB textbook.
