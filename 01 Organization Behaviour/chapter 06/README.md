# Perception and Decision Making


## 👁️ 1. Define Perception and Explain the Factors that Influence It  

### What is the Perception?
**Perception** is the process by which individuals organize and interpret what they see to give meaning to their environment. It is important because people's behavior is based on their *perception* of what reality is, not on reality itself.

### Factors that Influence Perception  

| Factor | Description | Organizational Example | 
| --- | --- | --- |
| **The Perceiver** | Personal characteristics of the person doing the perceiving (e.g., past experiences, motives, interests). |1. A manager who recently lost a lot of money in a risky investment (past experience) perceives a new, innovative project proposal as **reckless and irresponsible**, even though it has a solid business plan. **OR**  2. If a manager has a negative attitude toward young employees (believing they are lazy), they might perceive a young employee sitting quietly at their desk as "slacking off," even if that employee is actually thinking deeply about a project. |
| **The Target** | Characteristics of the thing being perceived (e.g., novelty, intensity, motion). | A new employee who wears a **bright red shirt** (intensity) to work is more likely to be noticed and remembered by colleagues on their first day than an employee who wears a muted gray shirt. |
| **The Situation** | Context in which the perception is made (e.g., time, work setting, social setting). | Seeing your boss wearing shorts at the company picnic is perceived as normal. Seeing your boss wearing shorts in a board meeting is perceived as unprofessional. The person is the same, but the situation changes your perception.|

## 🎯 2. Explain Attribution Theory and List the Three Determinants of Attribution  

### What is the Attribution Theory? 

**Attribution Theory** explains how managers and employees judge the causes of behavior, determining whether that behaviour is due to **internal factors** (personal responsibility) or **external factors** (situational forces).

### The Three Determinants of Attribution 

| Determinant | Question Asked by Manager | **Internal Attribution** (It's the employee) | **External Attribution** (It's the situation) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **1. Distinctiveness** | Does the employee fail at **other tasks**? | **Low Distinctiveness:** The salesperson *also* fails to submit reports on time and struggles with inventory management. | **High Distinctiveness:** The salesperson *excels* at everything else; this is the only client they have lost. |
| **2. Consensus** | Do **other employees** perform poorly in this situation? | **Low Consensus:** All other salespeople in the department met their quotas this month. | **High Consensus:** Sales across the *entire industry* dropped sharply due to an unexpected recession. |
| **3. Consistency** | Has the employee **behaved this way before**? | **High Consistency:** This salesperson has missed their quarterly quota for the last three quarters straight. | **Low Consistency:** The salesperson has met or exceeded their quota every quarter for the past five years until now. |

### Attribution Errors   
#### **Fundamental Attribution Error:**   
A manager observes an employee miss a project deadline. The manager immediately concludes, "This employee is **lazy and disorganized**" (internal cause) and fails to consider that the employee was given an **impossible deadline** and an inadequate budget (external cause).  

#### **Self-Serving Bias:**  
A team successfully completes a difficult project ahead of schedule. The team leader tells senior management, "**My strategic planning and leadership** made this happen" (internal cause). If the project had failed, the leader would have said, "The failure was due to **poor communication from the supplier**" (external cause).

## 🧠 3. Identify the Shortcuts Individuals Use in Making Judgments About Others  

These are mental shortcuts used to make rapid judgments, often leading to biases in performance reviews, hiring, and promotion decisions.

| Shortcut | Explanation | Organizational Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Selective Perception** | We only see what aligns with our own background and expectations. | An HR manager, who believes employees should show strong loyalty, only pays attention to a candidate's previous job tenure, **ignoring** the strong technical skills the candidate demonstrated during their brief contracts. |
| **Halo Effect** | Drawing a positive general impression from a single trait. | A software developer is known to be an **excellent public speaker**. The manager, impressed by their presentation skills, gives them high ratings in all areas, including coding efficiency and technical accuracy, even though those skills are average. |
|**Horns Effect**	|Drawing a general impression about an individual based on a single negative characteristic (opposite of the Halo Effect).|	An employee makes a major error on their first day. The manager rates the employee poorly on all subsequent performance reviews, believing they are inherently incompetent.|
| **Contrast Effects** | Our evaluation is influenced by recent encounters. | An average job candidate is interviewed immediately after two candidates who were completely unprepared. Due to the contrast, the average candidate is perceived as **exceptionally bright and well-qualified**. |
| **Stereotyping** | Judging someone based on the group they belong to. | A senior manager assumes a new team member, who is a recent university graduate, is only interested in social media and **assigns them only trivial tasks**, limiting their chance to prove their analytical skills. |

## 🔗 4. Explain the Link Between Perception and Decision Making  

perception directly controls how decisions are made in an organization, because people do not respond to facts alone—they respond to how they interpret those facts. At every step of decision-making, different perceptions can lead to very different decisions. 

### **Problem Identification:**  
In this stage same situation can be seen differently by different managers. A regional director sees a 2% drop in market share as a serious problem and wants immediate action. The CEO, however, perceives the same 2% drop as normal and not worth worrying about. This means that whether a problem even gets attention or resources depends entirely on how it is perceived, not on the numbers alone.

### **Alternative Development:** 
perception limits the choices a decision-maker considers. The project manager believes their team is not very capable. Because of this perception, the manager only thinks about simple and safe solutions and does not even consider bold or innovative options. Even if the team actually has the ability to handle a challenging project, the manager’s perception blocks high-reward opportunities before they are evaluated.

### **Data Interpretation:**  
In this stage shows how people interpret the same information differently. In the hiring committee, one member uses selective perception and focuses only on the university name of candidates, assuming that prestigious schools automatically mean high talent. As a result, this person ignores candidates who may have stronger practical experience and skills. This leads to biased judgments and possibly poor hiring decisions. 

**Conclusion**
Perception shapes what is seen as a problem, which options are considered, and how information is evaluated. If perception is biased or incorrect, the final decision is likely to be flawed—even when good data is available.

## 🔄 5. Apply the Rational Model of Decision-Making and Contrast it with Bounded Rationality and Intuition 

Decision-making in OB often involves contrasting three distinct methods.

### A. The Rational Model
The Rational Decision-Making Model describes how individuals should behave to maximize an outcome. It is a logical, six-step process:

- Define the problem.
- Identify the decision criteria.
- Allocate weights to the criteria.
- Develop the alternatives.
- Evaluate the alternatives.
- Select the best alternative (the one that maximizes the outcome).

**Goal:** To make the optimal decision by being perfectly objective and having complete information.

**Example:** A company needs to buy a new software system. A rational manager lists every requirement (criteria), assigns a weight to each (e.g., security is 50%, cost is 20%), researches every possible alternative, and picks the system with the highest weighted score.

### B. Bounded Rationality
**Definition:** The idea that individuals operate within the confines of a simplified model of the world because the human mind has limited capacity to process information.

**Contrast with Rationality:** Instead of seeking the optimal solution (maximizing), people seek a "satisficing" solution—the first acceptable solution they find. They choose the alternative that is "good enough."

**Example:** When buying the new software, a manager stops researching and evaluating as soon as they find a system that meets the minimum critical requirements (e.g., good security, decent price) even though a better, cheaper system might exist.

### C. Intuition
**Definition:** An unconscious process created from distilled experience, resulting in rapid decisions based on holistic associations and emotions.

**Contrast with Rationality:** Intuition is fast, highly subjective, and often relies on "gut feeling" rather than systematic analysis. It complements, but does not replace, rational analysis.

**Example:** An experienced emergency room doctor makes a split-second decision on how to treat a patient based on years of subconscious pattern recognition, rather than stopping to work through the rational model steps.

## 🚧 6. List and Explain the Common Decision Biases or Errors  
These cognitive errors reduce the quality of organizational decisions.


| Bias/Error | Explanation | Organizational Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Overconfidence Bias** | Being overly optimistic about future results. | The R&D lead is certain their team will finish the new product launch in three months, leading them to set an **unrealistic company deadline**, despite having only 50% of the required staff. |
| **Anchoring Bias** | Over-relying on initial information. | A compensation analyst anchors on the initial salary of a newly hired Vice President and uses that figure to set the salaries for all subsequent VPs, even after receiving new data suggesting the initial salary was below market rate. |
| **Confirmation Bias** | Seeking information that confirms existing beliefs. | A department manager, who believes remote work is inefficient, only collects feedback from other managers who are also critical of remote work and ignores all data showing increased productivity among their own remote staff. |
|**Availability Bias** |	Basing judgments on information that is readily available (e.g., information that evokes strong emotion or has recently occurred).	|A supervisor overemphasizes the importance of performance reviews after one employee's very recent, high-profile failure, despite a year of overall successful performance data.|
| **Escalation of Commitment** | Sticking with a failing decision due to prior investment. | A firm has spent $10 million on a manufacturing plant that is clearly unprofitable. The CEO refuses to sell the property because, "We've already invested too much to quit now," and continues to fund the loss. |
|**Randomness Error** |	Believing that one can predict the outcome of random events (a lack of critical thinking).	|A stock trader believes they are on a "hot streak" and keeps making high-risk trades, even though stock fluctuations are essentially random in the short term.|

## 🧩 7. Explain How Individual Differences and Organizational Constraints Affect Decision-Making 

### A. Individual Differences   

* **Personality (Conscientiousness):** A highly **conscientious** financial analyst spends so much time meticulously checking every assumption in a financial model that they miss the **deadline** to present the information, leading to a delayed investment decision (**analysis paralysis**).
* **Mental Ability/Intelligence:** During a crisis, an executive with **high general mental ability (GMA)** can quickly synthesize fragmented information from multiple teams and identify the core cause of the system failure, leading to a fast, accurate recovery plan.
* **Culture:** In a highly **collectivistic** business culture (e.g., Japan), a manager will delay a decision for weeks until **all stakeholders agree** (consensus), whereas a manager in an individualistic culture (e.g., U.S.) would make the decision unilaterally and quickly.

### B. Organizational Constraints  
* **Reward Systems:** A marketing director, whose bonus is tied to short-term social media traffic, will choose a **sensational, risky advertising campaign** over a safer, long-term brand-building campaign.
* **Formal Regulations:** A compliance officer must follow a strict, outdated company policy for approving supplier payments, even though they **know of a faster, more efficient method** that would save the company time and money.
* **Time Constraints:** A CEO has only two hours to review a potential merger deal before the bidding window closes. This **system-imposed time limit** forces the CEO to make a decision based on **bounded rationality**, accepting the lawyers' summarized risk assessment rather than performing a full due diligence review.

## ⚖️ 8. Contrast the Three Ethical Decision Criteria 
These criteria are frameworks managers use when facing moral dilemmas in the organization.

| Ethical Criterion | Focus | Organizational Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **1. Utilitarianism** | The greatest good for the greatest number. | A company decides to outsource its small IT department (laying off 20 people) because it will save the company enough money to **hire 100 new salespeople** and expand the business, benefiting the vast majority of employees. |
| **2. Rights** | Respecting and protecting individual freedoms and entitlements. | An employee anonymously reports a toxic work environment. Management is ethically obligated to **protect the identity** of the whistleblower and conduct an investigation (upholding the employee's right to safety and due process). |
| **3. Justice** | Fair and impartial application of rules and equity in resource distribution. | Two supervisors are caught engaging in the exact same unethical behavior (e.g., padding expense reports). To ensure justice, both must be **given the exact same disciplinary action** (e.g., a two-week suspension), regardless of which one is more senior or productive. |

## ✨ 9. Define Creativity and Discuss the Three-Component Model of Creativity 
### A. Definition of Creativity  
**Creativity** is the ability to produce ideas that are **novel (original) and useful (appropriate)** for a given organizational task.

**OR**

**Creativity** is the ability to produce novel and useful ideas—ideas that are different from what has been done before and that are appropriate to the task at hand.

### B. The Three-Component Model of Creativity  
Individual creativity in the workplace is the result of three interacting components:

1. **Expertise (The Knowledge):** The foundation of all creative work. It is the raw materials—the technical, procedural, and intellectual knowledge a person possesses. A senior chemist has 20 years of experience and deep knowledge of molecular structures. This forms the **necessary foundation** for any new drug discovery idea.

2. **Creative-Thinking Skills (The Approach):** The chemist is a risk-taker (personality) and uses analogies to compare molecular problems to historical engineering challenges. This gives them the **flexible mindset** needed to think outside the box.

3. **Task Motivation (The Drive):** The chemist is intrinsically motivated; they work on the problem because they genuinely want to cure a disease, not just to get a bonus. This **internal passion** drives them to work on the problem for months, even after multiple failed experiments.

The combination of these three components allows the chemist to develop a novel and useful drug compound.
