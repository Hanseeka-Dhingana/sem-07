# Introduction to Organization Behaviour 
Organization + Behaviour

### Organization 
Is a entity such as a company an institution, or an association comparising one or more people and having a particular puprose.   
Aggregation of Human Beings created for the attainment of certain goals.

## What is the Organization Behaviour
OB is systematic study of the actions and attitudes the people exhibit within organization and how organization structure and organization culture affect the bahaviour of people within organization.

**OR**

OB is field of study that invetigate the impact of individual, group and structure on behaviour within organization for the purpose of applying such knowledge towards improving organizational effectiveness. 

OB is an important topic for anyone who works or who will eventually working an organization, which is the case for the most people.

### It studies human behaviour at:**
- Individual Level
- Group Level
- Organization Level

<br>   

## The Organizational Behaviour Model  
A **model** means a **simplified picture of reality** — it helps us understand how different things (like people, teams, and organizations) are connected.
In OB, this model has **three main parts** and **three levels of analysis**.

### **Three Main Parts of the OB Model**

| Part          | Meaning                                                | Example                                                                          |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Inputs**    | The basic factors or variables that start the process. | A person’s **personality**, team structure, or company culture.                  |
| **Processes** | The actions or things people do with those inputs.     | How people **communicate**, **make decisions**, or **lead others**.              |
| **Outcomes**  | The results or consequences of those processes.        | Things like **job performance**, **team success**, or **organizational growth**. |

So, in simple terms:

> **Inputs → Processes → Outcomes**

<br>  

### **Three Levels of Analysis**
OB looks at behavior at **three levels** from individuals to the whole organization.

#### 1.**Individual Level**
Focus: One person’s behavior at work.
* **Inputs:** Personality, values, diversity.
* **Processes:** Motivation, perception, decision making, emotions, moods.
* **Outcomes:** Job performance, satisfaction, stress, and absenteeism.

**Example:**
An employee who is hardworking (input) feels motivated (process) and performs well at work (outcome).


#### **Group Level**
Focus: How people behave when working in teams.
* **Inputs:** Group structure, team roles, responsibilities.
* **Processes:** Communication, leadership, power, politics, conflict, and negotiation.
* **Outcomes:** Team performance and group cohesion.

**Example:**
A team with clear roles and open communication (inputs and processes) will perform better together (outcome).

#### **Organizational Level**
Focus: The organization as a whole.
* **Inputs:** Structure and culture of the organization.
* **Processes:** Human resource management, organizational change practices.
* **Outcomes:** Productivity, growth, and long-term survival.

**Example:**
A company with a strong, positive culture (input) and fair HR practices (process) will be more productive and successful (outcome).


### **Simple Example to Remember:**
Imagine a company:
* Hires positive, skilled people (**Input**)
* Motivates them and builds teamwork (**Process**)
* Achieves high performance and profits (**Outcome**)
That’s how the **OB model** works in real life!

## Who’s Who in the World of Work 
The main people or roles that exist in any workplace or organization.  

**1. Worker**   
A worker is any individual employee who helps the organization reach its goals. They directly do the work — such as making products, providing services, or performing daily tasks.
*Example:* A teacher in a school, a cashier in a store, a nurse in a hospital.   

**2. Manager**     
A manager doesn’t do all the work alone. Instead, they achieve goals through other people by planning, organizing, leading, and controlling their team.
*Example:* A school principal manages teachers, a factory supervisor manages workers.   

**3. Organization**    
An organization is a structured group of people who work together to achieve common goals. It is consciously coordinated, meaning it’s not random — everyone has specific roles and responsibilities.
It continues over time, not just for one task.
*Example:* A company, a school, a hospital, or even a charity.     

<br>  

## Management Activities/Functions
Management means getting things done through other people by planning, organizing, leading, and controlling their efforts so the organization can achieve its goals effectively and efficiently.    

### There are four key management functions  
#### 1. Planning  
Deciding what to do, how to do it, when to do it, and who will do it.
Planning, the first managerial function, is teh process of determining the organizations's desired future position and deciding how best to get there.  

*Example:*
A manager decides the monthly sales target, sets deadlines, and plans how the team will reach it.   

#### 2. Organizing   
Arranging people, tasks, and resources to carry out the plan.
Managers assign roles and responsibilities. They group similar tasks and create a clear structure (departments, teams, etc.). It ensures everyone knows what to do and who to report to.

*Example:*
In a school, the principal organizes teachers by subjects — science teachers, math teachers, etc.

#### 3. Leading   
Leading, the third major mangerial function, is the process of motivating members of the organization to work together towards the organizations's goals.   

*Example:*
A team leader motivates employees through appreciation and feedback to improve performance.   

#### 4. Controlling  
The process of monitoring and correcting the actions of the organization and its people to keep them headed toward their goals.  
*Example:*
A manager reviews monthly sales reports and changes the strategy if sales are lower than expected.

## **What Are Managerial Roles?**

The concept of **managerial roles** was introduced by **Henry Mintzberg**, a management researcher.
He studied how managers actually spend their time at work and found that managers don’t just **plan, organize, lead, and control**, they also **play certain roles** while doing these activities.

> A **managerial role** is the **set of behaviors or activities** that a manager performs as part of their job.

### **Mintzberg’s 10 Managerial Roles**
Mintzberg grouped these roles into **three main categories**:

1. **Interpersonal Roles** – dealing with people
2. **Informational Roles** – handling and sharing information
3. **Decisional Roles** – making decisions

## The Manager ’s Skills
In general, most successful managers have a strong combination of technical, interperonal, conceptual, and diagnostic skills. Management skills impact organizational behaviour and success in profoud ways.      

### Technical Skills  
Technical skills are skills necessary to accomplish specific tasks within the organization.   
- Mostly needed at lower levels of management (like supervisors or team leaders).
*Example:*
An accounting manager who knows how to use Excel and prepare financial reports.

### Human/people skills    
The ability to work well with other people — to understand, motivate, and communicate effectively.
- Managers with strong human skills build good relationships with their team.
- Needed at all levels of management.
*Example:*
Listening to employees’ problems, giving feedback, resolving conflicts.

### Conceptual Skills   
A manager with strong conceptual skills is able to see the **big picture**. That is, she or he can see opportunity where others see roadblocks or problems.  
- These skills help managers analyze situations, think creatively, and solve complex problems.
- Needed most by top-level managers (like CEOs, directors).
*Example:*
Understanding how marketing, finance, and production departments affect each other.

## **Complementing Intuition with Systematic Study**
### 🔍 **1. What It Means**

When we deal with people, we often **rely on intuition** — our **gut feeling** or past experience — to predict how they’ll behave.
But this “casual” way of understanding people can be **wrong or biased**.

So, we should **complement (add to)** our intuition with a **systematic study** that means using **scientific evidence, data, and research** to make better, more accurate decisions about human behaviour.

### 🧠 **2. Why Systematic Study Matters**

* Human behaviour is **not random** — it has **patterns and consistencies**.
* Because of those patterns, we can **predict behaviour** to some extent.
* Systematic study helps us understand **why people behave** a certain way, by looking at **cause-and-effect relationships** and using **data collected carefully and scientifically**.

So instead of guessing, we make **evidence-based decisions**.

### 📊 **3. Evidence-Based Management (EBM)**
 **Evidence-Based Management (EBM)** means managers should make decisions based on the **best available scientific evidence**, just like doctors rely on medical research before treating patients.

In EBM:
1. Managers **ask questions** about problems.
2. They **search for evidence** (research, data, expert advice, etc.).
3. They **apply** that evidence to make decisions.

But in reality, most managers still make decisions **“on the fly”** — based on gut feelings or common sense, not evidence.

### ⚖️ **4. Balancing Intuition and Evidence**
we shouldn’t completely ignore intuition experience and instinct are useful!
However, decisions made **only** on gut feeling are **incomplete**  like investing with only half the information.

So, **the best approach** is to **combine both**:
* Use **intuition** for quick insights.
* Use **systematic study and EBM** to **verify** and **support** those insights with facts.

## Identify the major behavioral science disciplines that contribute to OB
This is an important topic in **Organizational Behaviour (OB)** because OB is an **interdisciplinary field**, meaning it takes ideas and research from different behavioral sciences to understand human behavior at work.

### 🧠 1. **Psychology**
➤ **Meaning:** Psychology is the **study of human behavior and mental processes** — how people think, feel, and act as individuals.   
➤ **Contribution to OB:** Psychology helps us understand **individual behavior** in organizations.   
📘 *Focus level: Individual.*


### 👥 2. **Social Psychology**

➤ **Meaning:** Social psychology is the study of **how people influence and interact with one another**. It’s a bridge between psychology and sociology.   
➤ **Contribution to OB:** Social psychology helps us understand **group behavior** and **team dynamics** in organizations.   
📘 *Focus level: Group.*


### 🏢 3. **Sociology**
➤ **Meaning:** Sociology studies **how people behave in social systems or organizations**, like how social structures, culture, and relationships affect behavior.  
➤**Contribution to OB:** Sociology helps us understand the **organizational system as a whole**, its structure, culture, and environment.   
📘 *Focus level: Organization.*


### 🌍 4. **Anthropology**
 ➤ **Meaning:** Anthropology studies **people and their cultures**, including values, beliefs, and traditions often across societies.  
➤ **Contribution to OB:** Anthropology helps managers understand **differences in work culture and behavior** in **global or multicultural organizations**.    
📘 *Focus level: Culture and Environment.*

### 🧩 Summary Table

| Discipline            | Focus Level         | Contribution to OB                              |
| --------------------- | ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| **Psychology**        | Individual          | Personality, motivation, perception, learning   |
| **Social Psychology** | Group               | Communication, teamwork, attitude change        |
| **Sociology**         | Organization        | Structure, culture, leadership, change          |
| **Anthropology**      | Culture/Environment | Cross-cultural behavior, organizational culture |


<br>  

## There Are Few Absolutes in OB
In **physical sciences** (like physics or chemistry), laws are **universal and consistent**. For example, gravity works the same way everywhere. But in **Organizational Behaviour**, we study **people**, and people are **not all the same**. So, there are **no fixed or absolute laws** in OB that apply equally to everyone and every situation.

### 🧠 **Why?**
Because:
* Every person is **unique** (different personalities, emotions, values).
* Every situation is **different** (different jobs, cultures, environments).
* So, the **same rule or strategy** may not work for everyone.

### 🧍 Example:
* You may act **calm and formal** in a **job interview**,
  but **relaxed and casual** with **friends**.
  → Same person, **different behavior** in different situations.

### ⚖️ **The Contingency Approach**
The Contingency Approach means there is no single best way to manage people or solve problems. What works in one situation may not work in another it depends on the situation and the people involved.

*Example:*
Imagine you are a manager of two teams:
- Team A is full of experienced workers who know their job well.
- Team B is made up of new employees who need guidance.
If you use the same leadership style for both teams, it may not work well.
- With Team A: You can give freedom — they work better when trusted.
- With Team B: You should give more instructions and support they need direction.
  
So, your management style depends on the team this is the Contingency Approach.
