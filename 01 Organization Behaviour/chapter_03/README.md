# Job Attitudes  

## What is the Job Attitudes
Job attitudes are the positive or negative feelings employees have toward various aspects of their job, such as their tasks, co-workers, supervisors, or the organization as a whole.     

<br>  

## **Three Components of an Attitude (The CAB Model)**

Attitudes are **evaluative statements**—they express how we feel about people, objects, or events.
*For example:*
“I like my job.” → This shows your positive attitude toward your job.

Researchers describe **three components** of an attitude:

| **Component**                          | **Meaning**                                                                                             | **Example**                                                                                           | **Keyword**         |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| **1. Cognitive Component (Cognition)** | This is the **belief or opinion** part of an attitude. It reflects what you **think** about something.  | “My pay is low.” → You *believe* you are underpaid.                                                   | **Think / Belief**  |
| **2. Affective Component (Affect)**    | This is the **emotional or feeling** part of an attitude. It reflects how you **feel** about something. | “I’m angry about how little I’m paid.” → You *feel* upset.                                            | **Feel / Emotion**  |
| **3. Behavioral Component (Behavior)** | This is the **action or intention** to act in a certain way because of your attitude.                   | “I’m going to look for another job that pays better.” → You *act* based on your feelings and beliefs. | **Act / Intention** |

### How They Are Connected:

These three parts are **interrelated**:
* Your **beliefs (cognition)** influence your **feelings (affect)**.
* Your **feelings** influence how you **act (behavior)**.
* *Example:* If you believe your supervisor is unfair → you feel angry → you behave by avoiding or complaining.

This is why they’re often called **“The ABCs of Attitude”**:

> **A**ffect (Feeling) → **B**ehavior (Action) → **C**ognition (Belief)


### Why It Matters in Organizational Behaviour:
In the workplace:
* Attitudes influence **job satisfaction**, **commitment**, and **turnover**.
* If employees **think** the organization is unfair (cognitive), **feel** frustrated (affective), and **plan to quit** (behavioral), that’s a negative attitude.
* Managers need to understand these components to **predict and manage employee behavior**.

## **Attitude and Behaviour**

| **Aspect**             | **Attitude**                                                                                            | **Behaviour**                                                                          |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Meaning**            | Attitude is a person’s **inner feeling, belief, or evaluation** about something (positive or negative). | Behaviour is a person’s **observable action or response** toward something or someone. |
| **Nature**             | **Internal (mental/emotional)** – it exists inside the mind.                                            | **External (visible)** – it can be seen or observed.                                   |
| **What it shows**      | What a person **thinks or feels**.                                                                      | What a person **does or says**.                                                        |
| **Components**         | Has 3 parts: **Cognitive (belief)**, **Affective (feeling)**, **Behavioral (intention)**.               | Actual **action or conduct** based on attitude or situation.                           |
| **Dependence**         | It is the **cause** or **reason** behind behaviour.                                                     | It is the **result** or **outcome** of attitude.                                       |
| **Example (positive)** | “I like my job.” → (positive attitude)                                                                  | “I work hard and stay motivated.” → (behaviour based on that attitude)                 |
| **Example (negative)** | “I dislike my boss.”                                                                                    | “I avoid talking to my boss.”                                                          |
| **Can it be seen?**    | No, it’s internal and must be inferred.                                                               | Yes, it’s directly observable.                                                       |

### **Example from daily life:**

* Student’s attitude: “I love studying.”
* Behaviour: Studies daily and participates in class.

Another:

* Employee’s attitude: “I hate my job.”
* Behaviour: Comes late, works carelessly, or looks for another job

### **Relationship:**
> **Attitude → predict → Behaviour**
> but sometimes
> **Behaviour → influence → Attitude** (because of cognitive dissonance).

<br>  

### **What Is Cognitive Dissonance?**
**Cognitive dissonance** means **a conflict or inconsistency between two or more attitudes, or between attitude and behaviour.**

> In simple words: It’s when what you **think or feel** doesn’t match what you **do** and it makes you uncomfortable.

### **Example:**

* You **know** smoking is bad (attitude).
* But you **still smoke** (behaviour).
  → This mismatch creates **tension or discomfort (dissonance)**.

So, to reduce that tension, you might:

* **Change your attitude:** “It’s not *that* harmful.”
* **Change your behaviour:** Quit smoking.
* **Find justification:** “I only smoke when I’m stressed.”

<br> 

## **Main Types of Job Attitudes:**
### 1.Job Satisfaction
A positive feeling about one’s job that comes from evaluating its characteristics (like pay, work conditions, coworkers, etc.).    
*Example:*   
Sara works as a teacher and feels happy because her students respect her, and her school environment is supportive.
- She has high job satisfaction.
- If she feels underpaid or disrespected, she may develop low job satisfaction.

*Why it matters:*    
High satisfaction leads to better performance, motivation, and less absenteeism.

### 2.Job Involvement
how much a person is psychologically attached to their job and sees it as part of their identity.   
*Example:*   
Ali is a software developer who loves solving coding problems and feels proud when his project succeeds.
 - His identity is connected to his job that he is highly involved.
If he only works for salary and doesn’t care about results,
- low job involvement.

*Why it matters:*    
High job involvement = more effort, creativity, and satisfaction.

### 3.Organizational Commitment
The degree to which an employee feels loyal and attached to the organization.   
*Example:*    
Hina has worked at her company for 10 years. She believes in its mission and doesn’t want to leave even if offered more money elsewhere.
- She has strong organizational commitment.

**Types of commitment:**    
* Affective: Emotional attachment (she loves the company).
* Normative: Feels obligated to stay (company supported her, so she should stay).
* Continuance: Can’t afford to leave (no better options).

*Why it matters:*    
Committed employees stay longer, perform better, and support company goals.  


### 4.Perceived Organizational Support (POS)
How much employees believe their organization values their contribution and cares about their well-being.   

*Example:*   
When Ahmed got sick, his company paid his medical bills and allowed flexible working hours.
- He feels supported and becomes more loyal and motivated.
If the company ignored him during his illness, his POS would be low.

*Why it matters:*    
High POS → more trust, loyalty, and better performance.

### 5.Employee Engagement
The level of enthusiasm, energy, and passion an employee brings to their job.
It means giving your “heart and soul” to your work.    

*Example:*     
Ayesha works in marketing and always comes up with new ideas, helps her teammates, and feels proud of her company.
- She is highly engaged.
A disengaged employee just “does the job” without caring about results.

*Why it matters:*    
Engaged employees perform better, reduce turnover, and make the workplace positive.  

### 6. Organization Identification  
How strongly an employee feels that they belong to their organization, like the company is part of their own identity.        
*Example:*    
Sara works at Google. When she talks about her job, she says, “We at Google are making life easier for everyone.”
This shows she connects herself with Google’s goals — she feels like Google’s success is her own success.

*Why it matters:*    
- It builds loyalty and employees stay longer and work harder.
- But sometimes, it can make them ignore wrong things happening in the company just to protect its image.

### Job Attitudes in the Gig Economy (Freelancers & Contract Workers)
Gig workers (like Uber drivers, freelancers) can also develop job attitudes.
- If their work is meaningful and stable, and they feel supported,
- they show high satisfaction and commitment.
- But temporary agency workers (short-term contracts) often feel less satisfied and less attached.   
  
### Are These Job Attitudes Different?
They overlap (e.g., satisfied workers are often committed and engaged).      
*But they still have unique aspects:*   
- **Satisfaction** → positive reaction to job.
- **Commitment** → loyalty to organization.
- **Involvement** → Connection with your work.
- **Engagement** → energy and enthusiasm.
- **POS** → belief in organizational care and support.

<br>  

## **Job Satisfaction**  
A person’s positive feeling about their job based on evaluating job characteristics (pay, work itself, supervision, coworkers, promotion, etc.).  

### Two popular approaches for measuring job satisfaction  
#### **1.Single global rating**   
* One direct question that asks the employee to rate their overall satisfaction.
* Typical item: **“All things considered, how satisfied are you with your job?”**
* Response scale is usually numeric (e.g., **1 = Highly dissatisfied** to **5 = Highly satisfied** or 1–7).    

**Example**   
* Employee chooses **4** on a 1–5 scale → moderately satisfied.

**How to score**    
* Use the numeric value directly (mean, median, % satisfied).
* Track over time (monthly/annual averages).

**Advantages**   
* Very quick and easy to administer.
* Low respondent burden → higher response rates.
* Good for large-scale monitoring and quick pulse checks.

**Disadvantages**   
* Not diagnostic  it does NOT tell managers *why* people are satisfied or not.
* Single-item measures can’t show internal reliability (though research shows single-item global satisfaction is often valid for overall satisfaction).

**When to use**   
* Quick surveys, pulse checks, or when you just need an overall indicator.


#### 2) **Summation-of-facets (facet approach)**
* Measure satisfaction with several **specific job facets** (elements), then add/average those facet scores to get an overall satisfaction score.
* Common facets: **work itself, pay, supervision, coworkers, promotion opportunities, working conditions, autonomy, recognition, job security, schedule.**

**Example (facet items)**     
Rate each from 1–5:

  * Pay: 2
  * Work itself: 4
  * Supervision: 3
  * Coworkers: 5
  * Promotion opportunities: 2
* Overall facet score = average or sum (e.g., average = (2+4+3+5+2)/5 = 3.2).

**How to score**   
* Sum or average facet scores.
* Compute subscale scores (e.g., mean for “pay” items if multiple items per facet).
* Check reliability for multi-item facets (e.g., Cronbach’s alpha).

**Advantages**   
* Diagnostic shows **which areas** cause dissatisfaction so managers can target interventions.
* More content validity (covers the job’s different aspects).
* Useful for detailed analyses and action planning.

**Disadvantages**   
* Longer surveys → higher respondent burden.
* More work in analysis and interpretation.
* If poorly designed, may collect redundant items.

**When to use**   
* When you want to find root causes and build targeted interventions (e.g., fix pay or promotion systems).

#### Which method is better?   
* **Intuition:** facets should be more accurate because they capture specifics.
* **Research:** surprisingly, a **single global item often performs about as well** as the summation method for predicting broad outcomes (e.g., turnover, performance). That’s why both methods are used in practice.
* **Best practice:** many organizations **use both** — a global item plus a set of facet questions. This gives a quick overall score and the detail needed for action.



### Practical steps for managers (how to measure and act)
1. **Decide the goal**: quick pulse (use single item) or diagnose problems (use facets).
2. **Design the survey**: include a global item and 6–10 facet items (1–5 scale).
3. **Pilot** the questions with a small group to check clarity.
4. **Collect data** confidentially.
5. **Analyze**:

   * Overall mean/median for global item.
   * Facet means and rank-order to find weakest areas.
   * Check reliability for multi-item facets.
6. **Interpret carefully**: watch for response biases (mood, social desirability).
7. **Act**: create action plans targeting low-scoring facets (e.g., improve pay structure, supervisor training).
8. **Follow up**: re-measure to see if satisfaction improved.

## What causes job satisfaction?
Job satisfaction comes from many things. The main causes are:  

1. Job conditions (the nature of the work and the workplace)
2. Personality and individual differences
3. Pay and comparisons about pay

### 1. Job conditions (the nature of the work and the workplace)
These are the features of the job and the workplace that make day-to-day work pleasant or unpleasant.
- Interesting work / meaningful tasks: People like jobs that use their skills and feel important.    
Example: A schoolteacher who sees students improve feels the job is meaningful → higher satisfaction.  

- Variety & training: Jobs that change up tasks and offer learning keep employees engaged.   
Example: A software engineer who rotates between front-end and back-end tasks and gets training stays motivated.
- Autonomy / control: Having freedom to decide how to do the work increases satisfaction.   
Example: A sales rep who sets their own schedule feels trusted and happier.
- Social support & relationships: Good relationships with coworkers and friendly team culture raise satisfaction.   
Example: Coworkers who hang out after work or help each other reduce stress and increase happiness.

- Safe, non-toxic environment: Absence of bullying, discrimination, or harassment is crucial. Toxic environments cause strong dissatisfaction and harm health.   
Example: An employee experiencing racial discrimination will likely feel unhappy, stressed, and may perform worse.

- Supervisor quality / leader-member exchange: How supervisors treat employees strongly affects satisfaction. If managers are fair, supportive, and communicate well, employees are more satisfied.   
Example: A manager who mentors staff, gives recognition, and listens increases their team’s satisfaction.


### 2. Personality and individual differences
People are different, so the same job affects people differently.

- Intelligence & job complexity: Intelligent people often prefer complex jobs. If their job matches that need, they are more satisfied.   
Example: An intelligent person placed in repetitive data entry will be bored and unhappy; put them in analysis work and satisfaction rises.

- Person–job fit: When a person’s interests and skills match the job (e.g., an artistic person in an artist role), satisfaction is higher.    
Example: Someone who loves art will feel satisfied as a graphic designer but unhappy as an accountant.

### 3. Pay (salary) and comparisons about pay
Money matters, but not in a simple way.

- Pay level matters, but only up to a point. People need a comfortable standard of living; beyond that, more money has smaller effects on satisfaction.   
Example: Getting a raise from very low wages to a living wage can greatly increase happiness. A multimillion-dollar increase for someone already wealthy usually changes happiness little.

- Relative pay (comparison) matters. People compare with peers. If you earn less than colleagues doing the same job, satisfaction can drop.  
Example: Two nurses earn the same, but one finds out a colleague with similar experience earns more → the first nurse feels unfairly treated and becomes dissatisfied.

- Pay motivates behavior but doesn’t always make people happy. Money can get people to work harder (motivation) but it doesn’t always create deep job satisfaction if other job conditions are poor.   
Example: A well-paid investment banker may still be unhappy because of long hours and stressful culture; a modestly-paid teacher may be very satisfied due to meaningful work.

<br> 

## **Outcomes of Job Satisfaction**
Job satisfaction doesn’t just make people feel good. It actually affects how they work, how they treat others, and how they feel about life overall.
Researchers have found that when employees are satisfied, organizations perform better.

### There are four main outcomes of job satisfaction:
#### **1.Job Performance** 
> Happy workers tend to be more productive workers.      
When employees are satisfied with their job meaning they enjoy the work, respect their boss, and feel valued. They’re more motivated, focused, and creative.
This leads to better performance, higher quality work, and more innovation.

*Example:*   
Google company consistently ranks among the best companies to work for.
Why? Because it focuses heavily on employee satisfaction flexible hours, creative freedom, learning opportunities, and supportive managers.   

*Result:*    
- Developers and engineers feel happy and empowered.
- They perform better creating innovative products like Gmail, Google Maps, and AI tools.
- So, high job satisfaction → high job performance → company success.

#### **2.Organizational Citizenship Behavior (OCB)**
> **Satisfied employees go “above and beyond” their job requirements.**

**OCB (Organizational Citizenship Behavior)** means employees:  
* Help coworkers voluntarily,
* Speak positively about the company,
* Stay late to finish urgent work,
* Support new employees,
* Care about the organization’s reputation.

Job satisfaction encourages this because:

* Satisfied employees **trust their managers**,
* Feel **loyal to the organization**, and
* Have **positive relationships** with coworkers.

They don’t just do their job — they **act like owners** of the company.

*Example*   
At Microsoft, satisfied engineers often volunteer to mentor interns, contribute to open-source projects, or help teammates with debugging even if it’s not in their job description.
This teamwork spirit improves the entire company culture.
- When employees are happy and feel trusted, they help more and managers, in return, trust them more. It creates a **positive loop of cooperation and trust.**

#### Customer Satisfaction 
> **Satisfied employees create satisfied customers.**

When employees are happy, they:

* Treat customers better,
* Show more patience,
* Go the extra mile to solve problems,
* Create better user experiences (especially in tech or service jobs).
  
In contrast, unhappy employees often show frustration, impatience, or carelessness, which makes customers unhappy.

*Example*    
Zappos(Online Retailer) became famous for **employee happiness = customer happiness**.

They even pay new hires **$2,000 to quit after training** if they’re not happy, because they only want satisfied people serving customers.
Zappos customer service agents are encouraged to be fun, kind, and creative. That’s why **75% of customers are repeat buyers**!


#### Life Satisfaction

> **Job satisfaction and life satisfaction are closely connected.**

Your job is a big part of your life where you spend most of your day.
So if you’re happy at work, it naturally increases your **overall life happiness**.
If you hate your job, it negatively affects your **mood, energy, and relationships** outside work.

Also, losing a job or being in an unhappy job reduces life satisfaction not just because of money, but because work gives people a **sense of purpose and identity**.

*Example* 
**A Software Engineer at Spotify**  
* When engineers at Spotify feel valued, have creative freedom, and enjoy teamwork, they go home feeling fulfilled and proud.
* Their job satisfaction spills into life they’re more positive with family and friends.

On the other hand:

* A developer working in a toxic startup with no work-life balance or respect may feel constantly stressed and unhappy even at home. Itlowering overall life satisfaction.



## The Impact of Job Dissatisfaction

When employees don’t like their jobs, it affects not only their own mood and performance but also the organization’s success.
They may react in different ways — some positive, some negative.

To understand these reactions, OB researchers developed the **Exit–Voice–Loyalty–Neglect (EVLN) Framework.**
It shows the four main ways employees respond when they feel dissatisfied at work.      

<br>    

<img width="1491" height="846" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ab8cdff3-d629-4c34-b189-3353c58640fa" />    

<br>  

### 1.Exit – Leaving the Organization
When employees are unhappy and see no hope for improvement, they choose to quit or look for new jobs.

This can be measured by turnover, how many people leave a company over time.
When skilled employees leave, organizations lose knowledge, skills, and talent.  
*Example*  
At Meta (Facebook), during the “quiet quitting” wave in 2022, many employees were dissatisfied with constant restructuring and high work pressure.
As a result, a large number resigned and moved to startups or other tech firms.

This “exit” hurt Meta because:
- The company lost experienced software engineers.
- Productivity decreased.
- Hiring and training new employees cost time and money.
> **Exit = Active but destructive,** because employees take action but it harms the company.


### 2.Voice – Speaking Up to Improve Conditions
Instead of quitting, some employees try to fix problems.
They raise their concerns, give feedback, suggest ideas, or join unions to make things better.

*Example:*   
At Google, employees once protested the company’s involvement in a military AI project called Project Maven.
They didn’t quit — they voiced their dissatisfaction by organizing discussions, writing open letters, and suggesting ethical policies for AI usage.   

*Result:*  
- Google canceled the project contract.
- The company introduced stronger AI ethics guidelines.
> It’s active and constructive, because they want positive change.


### 3.Loyalty – Waiting and Hoping for Improvement
Some employees stay loyal even when they’re unhappy.
They don’t complain or quit they trust the company will fix the problems and wait patiently for things to get better.
- They may even defend the company when others criticize it.   
*Example:*   
At Twitter (before Elon Musk’s takeover), many long-term employees stayed loyal even though they disagreed with new policies and layoffs.
They hoped things would stabilize, defended the company online, and waited for leadership changes to bring improvement.

> Loyalty = Passive but constructive — they don’t act immediately, but they don’t harm the company either.


### 4.Neglect – Ignoring Work and Letting Things Get Worse
When dissatisfaction increases, employees stop caring.
They become lazy, late, careless, or absent often.
They allow their performance or the organization’s situation to worsen over time.

*Example:*   
Imagine a developer at Amazon who feels overworked and ignored by their manager.
They stop attending meetings, submit buggy code, or scroll on social media during work hours.

> Neglect = Passive and destructive, because it silently damages performance and morale.

### Counterproductive Work Behavior (CWB)  

When dissatisfaction gets worse, employees sometimes act out through negative or harmful behaviors this is called Counterproductive Work Behavior (CWB).

CWB means any intentional behavior that harms the organization or its members.
It’s also called deviant behavior or employee withdrawal.

*Examples of CWB:*
- Stealing office items or company data
- Gossiping or spreading negativity
- Coming late or being absent frequently
- Wasting time on social media
- Arguing with coworkers
- Refusing to cooperate
- Sabotaging work intentionally

*Example:*   
At Uber (2017), employees faced a toxic environment — long hours, lack of respect, and unfair leadership.
As dissatisfaction grew:
- Some employees started badmouthing the company online.
- Others wasted work time or were rude to customers and colleagues.
- Some even quit in frustration.

This damaged Uber’s public image and forced the company to completely rebuild its culture.    

*Lesson:*  
CWB happens when people feel frustrated and powerless.
Instead of solving the problem, they “get even” through small harmful actions.    


### Absenteeism (Being Absent Often)
Dissatisfied employees are more likely to skip work or take unnecessary leaves.
But the relationship is not always strong — it depends on other factors.   

*Examples:*   
- If employees can easily find another job, they take more leaves.
- If they feel guilty for being absent, they stay even if they’re unhappy.  

*Example:*   
At Microsoft, after introducing flexible remote work, absenteeism dropped because employees could take breaks when needed instead of skipping full days.
When companies ignore flexibility, absenteeism rises due to dissatisfaction.

### Turnover (Leaving the Job)
Job dissatisfaction is the strongest predictor of employee turnover.
Unhappy workers eventually leave the company.   
*Factors Affecting Turnover:*    
- **Alternative jobs:** When new job offers are available, employees are more likely to leave.
- **Human capital:** Skilled or educated workers (like software engineers) have more options, so they quit more easily.
- **Job insecurity:** Even satisfied employees may leave if they feel unsafe about their job.
- **Workplace contagion:** If many coworkers are unhappy and leaving, others are influenced to leave too.
- **Embeddedness:** Strong social and community ties make employees stay longer — even if they’re a little dissatisfied.   

*Example:*  
In 2023, many employees at Amazon Web Services (AWS) left due to dissatisfaction with long hours and low promotions.
But some stayed because they were embedded meaning they had strong local ties, friendships, and benefits they didn’t want to lose.
