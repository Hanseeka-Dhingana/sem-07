# Job Attitudes  

## What is the Job Attitudes
Job attitudes are the positive or negative feelings employees have toward various aspects of their job, such as their tasks, co-workers, supervisors, or the organization as a whole.     

<br>  

## **Three Components of an Attitude (The ABC Model)**

Attitudes are **evaluative statements**—they express how we feel about people, objects, or events.
*For example:*
“I like my job.” → This shows your positive attitude toward your job.

Researchers describe **three components** of an attitude:

| **Component**                          | **Meaning**                                                                                             | **Example**                                                                                           | **Keyword**         |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| **1. Cognitive Component (Cognition)** | This is the **belief or opinion** part of an attitude. It reflects what you **think** about something.  | “My pay is low.” → You *believe* you are underpaid.                                                   | **Think / Belief**  |
| **2. Affective Component (Affect)**    | This is the **emotional or feeling** part of an attitude. It reflects how you **feel** about something. | “I’m angry about how little I’m paid.” → You *feel* upset.                                            | **Feel / Emotion**  |
| **3. Behavioral Component (Behavior)** | This is the **action or intention** to act in a certain way because of your attitude.                   | “I’m going to look for another job that pays better.” → You *act* based on your feelings and beliefs. | **Act / Intention** |

### How They Are Connected:

These three parts are **interrelated**:
* Your **beliefs (cognition)** influence your **feelings (affect)**.
* Your **feelings** influence how you **act (behavior)**.
* *Example:* If you believe your supervisor is unfair → you feel angry → you behave by avoiding or complaining.

This is why they’re often called **“The ABCs of Attitude”**:

> **A**ffect (Feeling) → **B**ehavior (Action) → **C**ognition (Belief)


### Why It Matters in Organizational Behaviour:
In the workplace:
* Attitudes influence **job satisfaction**, **commitment**, and **turnover**.
* If employees **think** the organization is unfair (cognitive), **feel** frustrated (affective), and **plan to quit** (behavioral), that’s a negative attitude.
* Managers need to understand these components to **predict and manage employee behavior**.

## **Attitude and Behaviour**

| **Aspect**             | **Attitude**                                                                                            | **Behaviour**                                                                          |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Meaning**            | Attitude is a person’s **inner feeling, belief, or evaluation** about something (positive or negative). | Behaviour is a person’s **observable action or response** toward something or someone. |
| **Nature**             | **Internal (mental/emotional)** – it exists inside the mind.                                            | **External (visible)** – it can be seen or observed.                                   |
| **What it shows**      | What a person **thinks or feels**.                                                                      | What a person **does or says**.                                                        |
| **Components**         | Has 3 parts: **Cognitive (belief)**, **Affective (feeling)**, **Behavioral (intention)**.               | Actual **action or conduct** based on attitude or situation.                           |
| **Dependence**         | It is the **cause** or **reason** behind behaviour.                                                     | It is the **result** or **outcome** of attitude.                                       |
| **Example (positive)** | “I like my job.” → (positive attitude)                                                                  | “I work hard and stay motivated.” → (behaviour based on that attitude)                 |
| **Example (negative)** | “I dislike my boss.”                                                                                    | “I avoid talking to my boss.”                                                          |
| **Can it be seen?**    | No, it’s internal and must be inferred.                                                               | Yes, it’s directly observable.                                                       |

### **Example from daily life:**

* Student’s attitude: “I love studying.”
* Behaviour: Studies daily and participates in class.

Another:

* Employee’s attitude: “I hate my job.”
* Behaviour: Comes late, works carelessly, or looks for another job

### **Relationship:**
> **Attitude → predict → Behaviour**
> but sometimes
> **Behaviour → influence → Attitude** (because of cognitive dissonance).

<br>  

### **What Is Cognitive Dissonance?**
**Cognitive dissonance** means **a conflict or inconsistency between two or more attitudes, or between attitude and behaviour.**

> In simple words: It’s when what you **think or feel** doesn’t match what you **do** and it makes you uncomfortable.

### **Example:**

* You **know** smoking is bad (attitude).
* But you **still smoke** (behaviour).
  → This mismatch creates **tension or discomfort (dissonance)**.

So, to reduce that tension, you might:

* **Change your attitude:** “It’s not *that* harmful.”
* **Change your behaviour:** Quit smoking.
* **Find justification:** “I only smoke when I’m stressed.”

## **Main Types of Job Attitudes:**
### 1.Job Satisfaction
A positive feeling about one’s job that comes from evaluating its characteristics (like pay, work conditions, coworkers, etc.).    
*Example:*   
Sara works as a teacher and feels happy because her students respect her, and her school environment is supportive.
- She has high job satisfaction.
- If she feels underpaid or disrespected, she may develop low job satisfaction.

*Why it matters:*    
High satisfaction leads to better performance, motivation, and less absenteeism.

### 2.Job Involvement
how much a person is psychologically attached to their job and sees it as part of their identity.   
*Example:*   
Ali is a software developer who loves solving coding problems and feels proud when his project succeeds.
 - His identity is connected to his job that he is highly involved.
If he only works for salary and doesn’t care about results,
- low job involvement.

*Why it matters:*    
High job involvement = more effort, creativity, and satisfaction.

### 3.Organizational Commitment
The degree to which an employee feels loyal and attached to the organization.   
*Example:*    
Hina has worked at her company for 10 years. She believes in its mission and doesn’t want to leave even if offered more money elsewhere.
- She has strong organizational commitment.

**Types of commitment:**    
* Affective: Emotional attachment (she loves the company).
* Normative: Feels obligated to stay (company supported her, so she should stay).
* Continuance: Can’t afford to leave (no better options).

*Why it matters:*    
Committed employees stay longer, perform better, and support company goals.  


### 4.Perceived Organizational Support (POS)
How much employees believe their organization values their contribution and cares about their well-being.   

*Example:*   
When Ahmed got sick, his company paid his medical bills and allowed flexible working hours.
- He feels supported and becomes more loyal and motivated.
If the company ignored him during his illness, his POS would be low.

*Why it matters:*    
High POS → more trust, loyalty, and better performance.

### 5.Employee Engagement
The level of enthusiasm, energy, and passion an employee brings to their job.
It means giving your “heart and soul” to your work.    

*Example:*     
Ayesha works in marketing and always comes up with new ideas, helps her teammates, and feels proud of her company.
- She is highly engaged.
A disengaged employee just “does the job” without caring about results.

*Why it matters:*    
Engaged employees perform better, reduce turnover, and make the workplace positive.  

### 6. Organization Identification  
How strongly an employee feels that they belong to their organization, like the company is part of their own identity.        
*Example:*    
Sara works at Google. When she talks about her job, she says, “We at Google are making life easier for everyone.”
This shows she connects herself with Google’s goals — she feels like Google’s success is her own success.

*Why it matters:*    
- It builds loyalty and employees stay longer and work harder.
- But sometimes, it can make them ignore wrong things happening in the company just to protect its image.

### Job Attitudes in the Gig Economy (Freelancers & Contract Workers)
Gig workers (like Uber drivers, freelancers) can also develop job attitudes.
- If their work is meaningful and stable, and they feel supported,
- they show high satisfaction and commitment.
- But temporary agency workers (short-term contracts) often feel less satisfied and less attached.   
  
### Are These Job Attitudes Different?
They overlap (e.g., satisfied workers are often committed and engaged).      
*But they still have unique aspects:*   
- **Satisfaction** → positive reaction to job.
- **Commitment** → loyalty to organization.
- **Involvement** → Connection with your work.
- **Engagement** → energy and enthusiasm.
- **POS** → belief in organizational care and support.

<br>  

## **Job Satisfaction**  
A person’s positive feeling about their job based on evaluating job characteristics (pay, work itself, supervision, coworkers, promotion, etc.).  

### Two popular approaches for measuring job satisfaction  
#### **1.Single global rating**   
* One direct question that asks the employee to rate their overall satisfaction.
* Typical item: **“All things considered, how satisfied are you with your job?”**
* Response scale is usually numeric (e.g., **1 = Highly dissatisfied** to **5 = Highly satisfied** or 1–7).    

**Example**   
* Employee chooses **4** on a 1–5 scale → moderately satisfied.

**How to score**    
* Use the numeric value directly (mean, median, % satisfied).
* Track over time (monthly/annual averages).

**Advantages**   
* Very quick and easy to administer.
* Low respondent burden → higher response rates.
* Good for large-scale monitoring and quick pulse checks.

**Disadvantages**   
* Not diagnostic  it does NOT tell managers *why* people are satisfied or not.
* Single-item measures can’t show internal reliability (though research shows single-item global satisfaction is often valid for overall satisfaction).

**When to use**   
* Quick surveys, pulse checks, or when you just need an overall indicator.


#### 2) **Summation-of-facets (facet approach)**
* Measure satisfaction with several **specific job facets** (elements), then add/average those facet scores to get an overall satisfaction score.
* Common facets: **work itself, pay, supervision, coworkers, promotion opportunities, working conditions, autonomy, recognition, job security, schedule.**

**Example (facet items)**     
Rate each from 1–5:

  * Pay: 2
  * Work itself: 4
  * Supervision: 3
  * Coworkers: 5
  * Promotion opportunities: 2
* Overall facet score = average or sum (e.g., average = (2+4+3+5+2)/5 = 3.2).

**How to score**   
* Sum or average facet scores.
* Compute subscale scores (e.g., mean for “pay” items if multiple items per facet).
* Check reliability for multi-item facets (e.g., Cronbach’s alpha).

**Advantages**   
* Diagnostic shows **which areas** cause dissatisfaction so managers can target interventions.
* More content validity (covers the job’s different aspects).
* Useful for detailed analyses and action planning.

**Disadvantages**   
* Longer surveys → higher respondent burden.
* More work in analysis and interpretation.
* If poorly designed, may collect redundant items.

**When to use**   
* When you want to find root causes and build targeted interventions (e.g., fix pay or promotion systems).

---

#### Which method is better?   
* **Intuition:** facets should be more accurate because they capture specifics.
* **Research:** surprisingly, a **single global item often performs about as well** as the summation method for predicting broad outcomes (e.g., turnover, performance). That’s why both methods are used in practice.
* **Best practice:** many organizations **use both** — a global item plus a set of facet questions. This gives a quick overall score and the detail needed for action.



### Practical steps for managers (how to measure and act)
1. **Decide the goal**: quick pulse (use single item) or diagnose problems (use facets).
2. **Design the survey**: include a global item and 6–10 facet items (1–5 scale).
3. **Pilot** the questions with a small group to check clarity.
4. **Collect data** confidentially.
5. **Analyze**:

   * Overall mean/median for global item.
   * Facet means and rank-order to find weakest areas.
   * Check reliability for multi-item facets.
6. **Interpret carefully**: watch for response biases (mood, social desirability).
7. **Act**: create action plans targeting low-scoring facets (e.g., improve pay structure, supervisor training).
8. **Follow up**: re-measure to see if satisfaction improved.

## What causes job satisfaction?
Job satisfaction comes from many things. The main causes are:  

1. Job conditions (the nature of the work and the workplace)
2. Personality and individual differences
3. Pay and comparisons about pay

### 1. Job conditions (the nature of the work and the workplace)
These are the features of the job and the workplace that make day-to-day work pleasant or unpleasant.
- Interesting work / meaningful tasks: People like jobs that use their skills and feel important.    
Example: A schoolteacher who sees students improve feels the job is meaningful → higher satisfaction.  

- Variety & training: Jobs that change up tasks and offer learning keep employees engaged.   
Example: A software engineer who rotates between front-end and back-end tasks and gets training stays motivated.
- Autonomy / control: Having freedom to decide how to do the work increases satisfaction.   
Example: A sales rep who sets their own schedule feels trusted and happier.
- Social support & relationships: Good relationships with coworkers and friendly team culture raise satisfaction.   
Example: Coworkers who hang out after work or help each other reduce stress and increase happiness.

- Safe, non-toxic environment: Absence of bullying, discrimination, or harassment is crucial. Toxic environments cause strong dissatisfaction and harm health.   
Example: An employee experiencing racial discrimination will likely feel unhappy, stressed, and may perform worse.

- Supervisor quality / leader-member exchange: How supervisors treat employees strongly affects satisfaction. If managers are fair, supportive, and communicate well, employees are more satisfied.   
Example: A manager who mentors staff, gives recognition, and listens increases their team’s satisfaction.
