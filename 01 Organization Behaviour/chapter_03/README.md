# Job Attitudes  

## What is the Job Attitudes
Job attitudes are the positive or negative feelings employees have toward various aspects of their job, such as their tasks, co-workers, supervisors, or the organization as a whole.     

<br>  

## **Three Components of an Attitude (The ABC Model)**

Attitudes are **evaluative statements**‚Äîthey express how we feel about people, objects, or events.
*For example:*
‚ÄúI like my job.‚Äù ‚Üí This shows your positive attitude toward your job.

Researchers describe **three components** of an attitude:

| **Component**                          | **Meaning**                                                                                             | **Example**                                                                                           | **Keyword**         |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| **1. Cognitive Component (Cognition)** | This is the **belief or opinion** part of an attitude. It reflects what you **think** about something.  | ‚ÄúMy pay is low.‚Äù ‚Üí You *believe* you are underpaid.                                                   | **Think / Belief**  |
| **2. Affective Component (Affect)**    | This is the **emotional or feeling** part of an attitude. It reflects how you **feel** about something. | ‚ÄúI‚Äôm angry about how little I‚Äôm paid.‚Äù ‚Üí You *feel* upset.                                            | **Feel / Emotion**  |
| **3. Behavioral Component (Behavior)** | This is the **action or intention** to act in a certain way because of your attitude.                   | ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to look for another job that pays better.‚Äù ‚Üí You *act* based on your feelings and beliefs. | **Act / Intention** |


### How They Are Connected:

These three parts are **interrelated**:

* Your **beliefs (cognition)** influence your **feelings (affect)**.
* Your **feelings** influence how you **act (behavior)**.
* *Example:* If you believe your supervisor is unfair ‚Üí you feel angry ‚Üí you behave by avoiding or complaining.

This is why they‚Äôre often called **‚ÄúThe ABCs of Attitude‚Äù**:

> **A**ffect (Feeling) ‚Üí **B**ehavior (Action) ‚Üí **C**ognition (Belief)


### Why It Matters in Organizational Behaviour:

In the workplace:
* Attitudes influence **job satisfaction**, **commitment**, and **turnover**.
* If employees **think** the organization is unfair (cognitive), **feel** frustrated (affective), and **plan to quit** (behavioral), that‚Äôs a negative attitude.
* Managers need to understand these components to **predict and manage employee behavior**.

Excellent ‚Äî this is one of the **most exam-focused topics** in Chapter 3 of Organizational Behaviour.
Let‚Äôs summarize and explain it **clearly and simply**, just like your book does üëá

## üß© **Relationship Between Attitudes and Behaviour**

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Basic Idea**

Attitudes and behaviour are **closely connected** ‚Äî
but the relationship is **not always perfect**.

* Usually, **attitudes predict behaviour**.

  > Example: If an employee dislikes their job (negative attitude), they may start looking for a new one (behaviour).

* However, sometimes **behaviour influences attitudes** ‚Äî especially when people try to reduce **cognitive dissonance** (explained below).

---

## ‚öñÔ∏è **What Is Cognitive Dissonance?**

üëâ **Definition:**
**Cognitive dissonance** means **a conflict or inconsistency between two or more attitudes, or between attitude and behaviour.**

> In simple words: It‚Äôs when what you **think or feel** doesn‚Äôt match what you **do** ‚Äî and it makes you uncomfortable.

---

### **Example:**

* You **know** smoking is bad (attitude).
* But you **still smoke** (behaviour).
  ‚Üí This mismatch creates **tension or discomfort (dissonance)**.

So, to reduce that tension, you might:

* **Change your attitude:** ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not *that* harmful.‚Äù
* **Change your behaviour:** Quit smoking.
* **Find justification:** ‚ÄúI only smoke when I‚Äôm stressed.‚Äù

## üîπ **When Attitudes Predict Behaviour Strongly**

Certain factors make the link between attitudes and behaviour **stronger**:

| **Factor**                      | **Explanation**                                                                                   | **Example**                                                           |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Importance of the attitude**  | If the attitude is linked to your **core values or self-interest**, it strongly guides behaviour. | You value honesty ‚Üí You refuse to cheat even if it benefits you.      |
| **Correspondence to behaviour** | The attitude must relate **directly** to the specific behaviour.                                  | Liking the company (general) ‚â† staying late for work (specific).      |
| **Accessibility**               | Attitudes you **often think about or express** are more likely to affect behaviour.               | If you often talk about fitness, you‚Äôre more likely to exercise.      |
| **Social pressure**             | Sometimes social norms **force behaviour** different from attitudes.                              | You dislike your boss but still act nice due to workplace rules.      |
| **Direct experience**           | Attitudes formed through **personal experience** are stronger and more likely to guide actions.   | You had a bad boss before ‚Üí you refuse to work with similar managers. |

## üîπ **When Behaviour Influences Attitude**

Sometimes, behaviour **comes first**, and then people **adjust their attitudes** to match what they did ‚Äî to reduce **cognitive dissonance**.

> Example: A manager supports a new policy they originally disliked because they already announced it publicly and don‚Äôt want to appear inconsistent.

This is called **‚Äúattitude following behaviour.‚Äù**

---

## üîπ **Reducing Cognitive Dissonance**

People naturally want **consistency** between their thoughts, feelings, and actions.
When inconsistency (dissonance) occurs, they try to reduce it by:

1. **Changing the attitude** (‚ÄúMaybe it‚Äôs not so bad.‚Äù)
2. **Changing the behaviour** (‚ÄúI‚Äôll stop doing it.‚Äù)
3. **Finding justification** (‚ÄúI had no choice.‚Äù)

---

## üîπ **Factors Affecting Desire to Reduce Dissonance**

| **Factor**                  | **Explanation**                                                                                      |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Importance of the issue** | The more serious or personal the issue, the more pressure to reduce dissonance.                      |
| **Degree of control**       | If you believe you had a choice in your behaviour, you‚Äôll feel more dissonance.                      |
| **Rewards**                 | If the behaviour has big rewards (like a high salary), the discomfort from dissonance feels smaller. |

## ‚úÖ **Summary (Easy to Remember)**

|                   | **Attitude ‚Üí Behaviour**                 | **Behaviour ‚Üí Attitude**                                       |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Direction**     | What we think or feel shapes what we do. | What we do can change what we think.                           |
| **Example**       | ‚ÄúI hate my job, so I‚Äôll quit.‚Äù           | ‚ÄúI already stayed in this job, so maybe it‚Äôs not that bad.‚Äù    |
| **Concept**       | Predictive relationship                  | Cognitive dissonance                                           |
| **OB Importance** | Helps managers predict employee actions. | Helps explain why employees justify or adapt to their actions. |

### üí¨ **In Simple Words:**

> Attitudes usually **guide our behaviour**,
> but when our behaviour **conflicts** with our attitudes,
> we experience **cognitive dissonance** ‚Äî and try to **reduce it** by changing our thoughts, actions, or justifications.

Would you like me to make a **short visual flowchart** (showing how attitude ‚Üí behaviour ‚Üí dissonance ‚Üí adjustment) for your OB notes?
